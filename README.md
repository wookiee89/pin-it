# Page Pinner Chrome Extension

Page Pinner is a Chrome extension that lets users quickly save and revisit their favorite web pages. It offers a one-click button to "pin" the active tab, saving its title and URL to a list. This list is accessible within the extension, and users can click on any saved entry to reopen the page in a new tab or remove it from the list.

## Features

- **Pin It**: Save the current tab's title and URL with one click.
- **Pinned List**: Easily view and access your list of saved pages.
- **Open Links**: Revisit saved pages by clicking on them in the list, opening in a new tab.
- **Manage Pins**: Delete any saved page from the list as needed.
